Spelling, grammar, translation and synonyms in one plugin, all of it
asynchronous and all of it acting on the buffer you are already in.
Translation needs no external Neovim plugin — `curl` and the keyless Google
endpoint work with zero configuration.

---

## Around it

> **[hover.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/hover.nvim)** — the word under
> the cursor, translated into a float. It is asked only on request rather than
> on every hover, because the keyless endpoint answers a passive contribution
> with HTTP 429 — the measurement is in
> [docs/FEATURES/HOVER.md](docs/FEATURES/HOVER.md).
>
> **[sessions.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/sessions.nvim)** — restores
> your workspace by project and branch, so a spell session and its target
> language come back where you left them instead of being set up again.
>
> **[trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim)** — a nicer list for
> the diagnostics a spell session produces. The session works without it; the
> quickfix list is the fallback.
>
> All of the above are soft: without them everything else works unchanged.
> [lib.nvim](https://github.com/StefanBartl/lib.nvim) is the one real
> dependency — see [Requirements](docs/requirements.md).

## Documentation

Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md), which says what is where and which
question each page answers.

**The Basics**

- [Requirements](docs/requirements.md) — Neovim version, required plugins and CLI tools.
- [Installation](docs/installation.md) — every plugin manager, and how to check that it took.
- [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) — the first thing to run after installing.

**Configuration**

- [What you get with the defaults](docs/what-you-get.md) — the full command/key surface at a glance.
- [All options](docs/configuration.md) — every `setup()` option over the defaults in `lua/language/config/DEFAULTS.lua`.
- [Usage](docs/usage.md) — the command reference: scopes, flags, and how to end each thing again.
- [Bindings](docs/BINDINGS.md) — every keymap, user command and autocmd, all of them opt-in and carrying a `desc`.

**The Rest**

- [Features](docs/FEATURES/README.md) — one page per theme: spell, translate, thesaurus, the shared core, and the hover contribution.
- [Workflow](docs/WORKFLOW.md) — how the pieces combine into a habit, and the two traps: `:Translate` against `:TranslateReplace`, and reading the confirmation before `--files=replace`.
- [Health check](docs/health.md) — the nine `:checkhealth language` sections, and which findings are actually problems.
- [Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) — ground rules, project layout, and how to add a provider.
- [Feedback](https://github.com/StefanBartl/language.nvim/issues) — bugs, feature requests and usage questions; broader discussion in [Discussions](https://github.com/StefanBartl/language.nvim/discussions).

`:help language` is the same reference inside the editor.
